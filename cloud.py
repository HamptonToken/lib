Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is a crowdsourcing website for businesses to hire remotely located "crowdworkers" to 
      perform discrete on-demand tasks that computers are currently unable to do. It is operated under Amazon Web Services, 
            and is owned by Amazon. Employers (known as requesters) post jobs known as Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs), 
                  such as identifying specific content in an image or video, writing product descriptions, or answering survey questions. 
                        Workers, colloquially known as Turkers or crowdworkers, browse among existing jobs and complete them in exchange for 
                              a fee set by the employer. To place jobs, the requesting programs use an open application programming interface (API), 
                                    or the more limited MTurk Requester site. As of April 2019, Requesters could register from 49 approved countries.
